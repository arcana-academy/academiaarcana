# Academia Arcana — hCaptcha Free: prepared / NO-GO

## Scope
- Isolated integration for `src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx`: login, signup and password-reset email.
- Do NOT add CAPTCHA to `updateUser({ password })` after authenticated recovery.
- CAPTCHA tokens are obtained only by the official browser SDK; Supabase Auth must perform the server-side verification.
- No new npm packages, paid resources, tokens in logs, external server routes, new databases or RLS changes.
- This change does **not** activate CAPTCHA protection on the live Supabase project.
- Production release remains **NO-GO**, Render Auto Deploy OFF, with all existing approval gates preserved.

## Configuration contract
1. **Create a site** in https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/sites using the free/publisher tier as available, and obtain the **public sitekey**. Only the sitekey may reach the browser.
2. Obtain the **secret key** from hCaptcha account settings. Never put it in Git, a GitHub issue/PR, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, browser code, client telemetry or build arguments.
3. For **isolated tests**, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITEKEY` to the non-production sitekey in the Next.js build environment. The Docker builder and runtime accept this **public** build argument; an existing built image must be rebuilt for the public variable to take effect. The production Render Blueprint also sets `ACADEMIA_ARCANA_REQUIRE_HCAPTCHA=1`: when that Blueprint is synced to the actual service, builds fail unless a correctly shaped **non-test** public sitekey is present. This checks only presence and format; it cannot prove the sitekey matches the configured secret or domain.
4. In the **separate, non-production Supabase project** only, go to Project Settings > Authentication > Bot and Abuse Protection, select **hCaptcha**, paste its secret in the provider dashboard securely, and enable CAPTCHA. Only enable after the updated frontend is deployed in that same test environment.
5. Test `/login`, `/cadastro`, `/recuperar-senha`, and `/redefinir-senha`, including mobile viewport and keyboard-only navigation.
6. Only after a release is separately authorized, configure the production **public sitekey** as a build-time public environment variable **in the actual Render service** (or its verified synced Blueprint), and confirm `ACADEMIA_ARCANA_REQUIRE_HCAPTCHA=1` is set. Verify that the build is not using the official public test sitekey. Confirm the built application actually contains this public sitekey; do not log its value. Deploy the verified frontend under the established release procedure, and only then enable CAPTCHA in production Supabase. Never enable the server gate first.
7. The previously shared screenshot exposed the hCaptcha secret. Rotate it directly in the hCaptcha provider dashboard, update the private value only in Supabase Auth, and invalidate the old secret. Do not display or copy it into GitHub, Render browser variables, shell histories, tickets or chat. If production CAPTCHA is already on with the old frontend, disable the enforcement until the frontend/secret are paired and verified.
8. The provider settings for Supabase Auth and actual Render runtime environment are not readable via the available linked service tools; neither the presence of a Sitekey in Render nor the provider's enabled state can be proven from this PR. Require operator-sanitized evidence (booleans only) and observed authorized browser tests.

## Fail-closed behavior
- With no public sitekey configured, existing authentication behavior is unchanged. This is a compatibility state, **not** evidence of bot protection.
- With a public sitekey configured, `AuthForm` requires a fresh completed challenge before each Supabase Auth request.
- The token is sent through `options.captchaToken` for signup/login or `captchaToken` for reset-password requests, then is reset after the request.
- Expired tokens and client SDK errors invalidate the challenge.
- If SDK initialization fails, the page presents a generic retry message. The Supabase call is not sent without a token.
- A missing or forged token must also be rejected by Supabase Auth **when server CAPTCHA is enabled**. Client-only checks are not a security boundary.
- Keep normal sign-in, password validation, generic account-recovery responses, rate limits, MFA, RLS and all other defenses.

## CSP
The existing nonce-based, strict-dynamic CSP remains in force. Only the official `https://hcaptcha.com` and `https://*.hcaptcha.com` sources were added as documented. No global `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval` permission was introduced in production.

## Required validation before release
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test -- src/components/auth/AuthForm.test.tsx src/lib/security/csp.test.ts scripts/verify-public-runtime-config.hcaptcha.test.mjs`.
- Run the non-production production build and all applicable authorization/accessibility/E2E gates. Keep previous green evidence; do not falsely mark unrun checks PASS.
- Confirm successful CAPTCHA token, missing token, invalid token, expired token, reused token, provider network failure, browser script block and small mobile viewport.
- Confirm provider's secret is configured and private in **test** Auth, no real student credentials used.
- Confirm fake accounts and generic recovery responses are handled correctly and no errors enumerate accounts.
- Observe external policy/API behavior, including CSP on real Chromium; unit mocks alone do not prove live hCaptcha compatibility.
- Add release evidence to draft PR; preserve NO-GO without the authorized release process.


## Render operator preflight (no production changes performed by this PR)

1. In the real Render service `academiaarcana`, review **Environment** for the public `NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITEKEY` and the nonsecret flag `ACADEMIA_ARCANA_REQUIRE_HCAPTCHA=1`. The current Render API connection does **not** expose a read-only environment-variable listing; the Blueprint alone is not evidence the service has these values. Never expose the secret to Render.
2. Review the live **Build Command** separately: the currently observed hosted value is not identical to the repository's `render.yaml`; do not assume a Blueprint file automatically changes the hosted configuration. Preserve the existing security guard and verified dependency lifecycle on any authorized reconciliation.
3. Check that the deployed commit is the intended, approved Git SHA. The latest observed LIVE commit prior to this integration was `b4f5eb3cdd345002349e7d9d30f826b4a57e5889` and lacks hCaptcha.
4. Before any manual deploy, confirm private secret rotation and that production CAPTCHA remains off until the new frontend and a real, permitted test account pass login, signup and recovery.
5. Preserve the independent release gates (#536, #594, #595, C03/ORG02); a green PR by itself is not publication approval.
